<h1>Cadec Ticker</h1>
A simple page that displays customer comments. The comments are cycled continuously. There is an admin page for adding and deleting information from the database.
I wrote this as a side-project for work and wanted to learn more about PHP and MySQL.

<h2>TODO:</h2>
The edit link isn't quite working yet. It will load the comment from the database but the 'make it so' button doesn't function yet.
