<h1>Cadec Ticker</h1>
A simple page that displays customer comments. The comments are cycled continuously using a javascript file I found somewhere. I would give credit but I can't remember where I found it.<br />
There is an admin page for adding and deleting information from the database.
The Display page grabs the contents of the table and throws them in li tags and the javascript cycles through the quotes.<br /><br />
I wrote this as a side-project for work and wanted to learn more about PHP and MySQL.

<h2>TODO:</h2>
The edit link isn't quite working yet. It will load the comment from the database but the 'make it so' button doesn't function yet.
